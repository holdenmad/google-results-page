#Google Results Page Project

##Priorities
- Reuse as much code as you can from Google Homepage project
- Focus on placement and order of items on the page
- Don't obsess about forms or where links go

##Post-Mortem Notes 
This project was definitely more difficult than the Google Homepage, although there was a lot of code that I could reuse. 

Parsing through the code to see what I could and could not use was in itself quite useful, and something that I can imagine happens quite often. 

The most challenging thing about this project was getting the padding and margins correct so that everything lined up. I'm not sure if I was entirely efficient with my classes and ids, but feel that I did a good enough job, and that aesthetically it looks right. 

Making two columns of text was ridiculously hard, and I have no idea why. There must be an easier way to do that...time will tell.

There were a few small things that I couldn't figure out how to do, and felt that I should move on to a different project:
- Profile pic and Google Apps icon are in a fixed position in the upper right hand corner of the screen, but they move with the viewport. I don't know how to keep them fixed in that place without moving with the viewport. At first I used flexbox and then fixed position. I'll figure it out eventually.
- Did not attempt to put small icons in the navigation bar, as aesthetically it looked very similar. 
- Search bar doesn't have icons attached to it, as I felt I didn't have the tools to do that easily.
